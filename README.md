# Loan Default Prediction Model

## Overview

This project involves developing a loan default prediction model to identify the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The model was trained on a dataset and evaluated using various classification algorithms.

## Project Details

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
- **Employment Status:** Indicates whether the applicant is employed.
- **Bank Balance:** Shows the applicant’s current bank balance.
- **Annual Salary:** Represents the applicant’s yearly income.
- **Loan Default Status:** Binary target variable (1 for default, 0 for no default).

### Models Used

Several classification models were evaluated, including:
- **Logistic Regression** (achieved 97% accuracy)
- Random Forest
- KNN Classifier
- Decision Tree

### Installation

To run the notebook locally, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```
